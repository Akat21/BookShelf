# BookShelf
Introducing Bookshelf – the ultimate mobile app crafted to elevate your book collection management experience to unparalleled heights.

With an exquisitely designed frontend built on the robust React Native framework, Bookshelf provides a seamless and visually captivating interface that brings your literary world to life. Navigating through your collection, adding new entries, and exploring book details becomes an intuitive and engaging journey.

On the backend, we've harnessed the power of cutting-edge technology to ensure the highest level of performance and reliability. Your book catalog finds its home in an SQL database, securely hosted on the Azure platform.

Our backend architecture is the Java SpringBoot framework. This choice guarantees a seamless flow of data, effortless scalability, and a foundation of rock-solid stability. The SpringBoot framework's elegance harmonizes perfectly with Bookshelf's mission – to provide you with a book collection management experience that is as elegant as it is functional.
